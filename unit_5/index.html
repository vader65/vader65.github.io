            <p>Welcome to my candy store site. We offer a variety of types of candies. Do you remember candies like Wax Lips, Bonomo’s Turkish Taffy, BB Bats, Candy Cigarettes, Candy Buttons on paper tape, or Zagnut? How about bulk candies like Mary Janes, Atomic Fireballs and Bit-O-Honey? You probably also remember going to the corner store and bringing home as many of these candies as you could carry. At Slade's Candy Store you’re able to easily find the Candy you ate as a kid®. Order a gift box of candy from your favorite decade, or pack your own assortment with our Pack-a-Bag option. Bulk candy is available in 2 lb. or 5 lb. bags and whole cases. So take a slow walk down the candy aisle. Go ahead, take your time. The memories are on us.</p>
